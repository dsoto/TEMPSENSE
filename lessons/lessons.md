# Confirm Measurement Chain

This lesson leads a student team to shared mastery of the technical links between the multiple temperature sensors and the text or graphical output of that temperature.
Interleaved teams of students master the connections between the sensor and the output and predict which of the sensors is related to which of the outputs.
Students commit their guesses and then heat or cool invidividual temperature sensors and verify the relationships and revise their mental models.

Here is a list of distinct pairs or mappings connecting the temperature sensor to the representation of the temperature on the screen.

- between the thermocouple and the amplifier
- between the amplifier and the specific output of the USB bridge chip
- between the USB bridge chip output and the software sensor object
- between the software sensor object and the software variables
- between the software variable and the textual or graphical output 

The lesson splits a classroom of students into groups.
Each group is provided with an computer, temperature sensor board, temperature sensor software, and materials helping them understand the conceptual operation of the measurement tool.
Each of these groups are assigned one of the connections above and collaborate so that each student in the group completely understands the connection.

After each group masters a single connection, these groups are interleaved to form groups such the group has an expert for each of the connections.
These interleaved groups then trace the signal from the sensor to the output, document their understanding, and predict which thermocouple corresponds to which text or graph element.
These predictions are then tested by heating or cooling the thermocouple and observing the change in the output on the screen.
If predictions are incorrect, students have an opportunity do discover which of their assumptions were incorrect.

# Graph Customization

Students collaborate and decide on the colors, shapes, and sizes of graph objects to represent the particular science lesson they are observing with the instrument.
